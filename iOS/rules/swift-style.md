# Swift Style Guide Compliance

Follow Apple's Swift API Design Guidelines and Swift.org style guide:

- Use meaningful, descriptive names
- Prefer value types over reference types when appropriate
- Use `guard` for early returns
- Use `final` on classes unless inheritance is needed

Naming conventions:

- `lowerCamelCase` for properties, methods, and variables
- `UpperCamelCase` for types, protocols, and enums
