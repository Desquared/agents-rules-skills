# Modern Swift & iOS

Use the latest Swift language features:

- async/await for asynchronous code
- Actors for thread-safe state
- Structured concurrency with TaskGroups

Framework preferences:

- Prefer SwiftUI over UIKit for new views unless specifically requested
- Use SwiftData over Core Data for new persistence
- Use Observation framework (@Observable) over Combine when applicable
